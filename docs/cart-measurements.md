# Gypsy Cart – Clearance Measurements
*Project: A Cabinet of Wild Hours*  
*Measured: 2025-09-18*  

## Purpose
Ensure the cart can fit through standard doorways (with and without the decorative crown).  

## Dimensions

### Width
- **Body width (cabin, max):** 48 in (4 ft)  
- **Wheel/axle span (outer edge to edge):** 33 in  
  → Note: **body extends beyond wheels**. Clearance must be based on 48 in.  

### Height (clearance-critical)

- Platform height (ground → floor): **26 in**
- Body height (floor → roof, no crown): **62 in**
- Crown height (decorative top): **14 in**

**Overall height, no crown:** **88 in** (7 ft 4 in)  
**Overall height, with crown:** **102 in** (8 ft 6 in)

**Total height (with crown):** 62 + 14 = **76 in** (6 ft 4 in)  

### Other Notes
- Standard residential doorway: ~36 in wide × 80 in tall.  
  - Width: Cart body exceeds standard doorway clearance by ~12 in.  
  - Height: Cart fits (crown removable if needed).  
- Transport solution will need **double doors, large entryway, or partial disassembly**.  
- Crown is removable; platform height useful for staging/display planning.
